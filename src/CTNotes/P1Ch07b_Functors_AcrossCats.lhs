`category-extras` defines `CFunctor` (quoted code):
```
class (Category r, Category s) => CFunctor f r s | f r -> s, f s -> r where
  cmap :: r a b -> s (f a) (f b)
```

Ignoring functional dependencies I define non-endofunctors as:

> class (Category r, Category s) => CFunctor f r s  where
>    cmap :: r a b -> s (f a) (f b)

With `PolyKinds` in place this assumes most generic kinds for `r` and `s`, `r :: k1 -> k1 -> *`
`r :: k2 -> k2 -> *`. That makes the definition usable with non-Hask categories like the categories
I created in [N_P1Ch03b_FiniteCats](N_P1Ch03b_FiniteCats) or [N_P1Ch03a_NatsCat](N_P1Ch03a_NatsCat)

Here is one polymorphic instance:

> instance (Category r) => CFunctor (Const a) r (->) where
>   cmap _ (Const v) = Const v

`Const` is defined (imported from `Data.Functor.Const` base package) as 
```
newtype Const a b = Const { getConst :: a }

Î»> :k Const
Const :: * -> k -> *
```

`PolyKinds` keeps kind of `b` polymorphic but the destination category has to have objects of kind `*` 
(it does not need to be `(->)`).  

I was able to define instance of `CFunctor` polymorphically (in `r`) because `Const` does not care about source category.
I am using (->) for destination, because this is what the implementation `\Const v -> Const v` uses.

To show that this works, I use category defined in the imported notes [N_P1Ch03b_FiniteCats](N_P1Ch03b_FiniteCats).

> test :: Const a (x :: Finite.Object) -> Const a (x :: Finite.Object)
> test = cmap Finite.MorphId

But this would not compile:

```
-- Bad code
test :: Const a (x :: Finite.Object) -> Const a (x :: Finite.Object)
test = cmap Finite.MorphAB
```
 
TODO: more examples?

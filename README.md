I am re-reading Bartosz Milewski excellent book 
[Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

This project contains code examples and notes from reading this book in literal Haskell.
The lhs files will be converted to md for easy readability. 

This is very much work in progress.

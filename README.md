# notes-milewski-ctfp-hs

I am rereading Bartosz Milewski's excellent book 
[Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

This project will contain code examples and (incomplete but focused) notes from reading this book in 
(mostly) literate Haskell.
The lhs files are converted to markdown and published as as wiki pages 
(see this project [wiki](https://github.com/rpeszek/notes-milewski-ctfp-hs/wiki/home) link). 

This is very much __work in progress__, but first wiki page is ready for viewing.

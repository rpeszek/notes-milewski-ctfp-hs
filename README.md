WORK IN PROGRESS. 

I am re-reading Bartosz Milewski's excellent book 
[Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

This project will contain code examples and (incomplete but focused) notes from reading this book in (mostly) literal Haskell.
The lhs files will be converted to md for easy readability and probably published as wiki. 

This is very much work in progress. Check back in a few weeks.

# Code Conventions
